# COSC2956 – Internet Tools
## Lecture 3: Routing & Views — Vue Router

---

!!! info "Lecture at a Glance"
    **Duration:** ~90 minutes &nbsp;|&nbsp; **Assumed knowledge:** Lec 1 + Lec 2 — Vue basics, components, props, emits

    | # | Phase | What changes | Time |
    |---|---|---|---|
    | 1 | What is routing? | Concept — no code | 10 min |
    | 2 | Install & configure Vue Router | Add router to the Watchlist project | 15 min |
    | 3 | `HomeView` + `MoviesView` | Two pages, `<RouterLink>` navbar | 15 min |
    | 4 | Route params — `MovieDetailView` | `/movies/:id` — click a card, see the detail page | 20 min |
    | 5 | Programmatic navigation | `router.push()` — navigate from code | 10 min |
    | 6 | Navigation guards | Redirect if a movie ID doesn't exist | 10 min |
    | 7 | Pitfalls & Wrap-up | | 10 min |

    **The project:** the Movie Watchlist from Lec 2. We are adding multiple pages — a Home page, a Movies list page, and a Movie Detail page. The URL changes as you navigate. No full page reloads.

---

## Phase 1 — What is Routing?

??? note "🗣️ Talking Points"
    - Ask: *"In a traditional website, what happens when you click a link?"* — a full HTTP request, the server responds with a new HTML document, the browser throws everything away and starts again.
    - Ask: *"Has anyone noticed that Gmail or YouTube doesn't do a full page reload when you navigate?"* That's client-side routing.
    - The key concept: in a SPA the browser loads one HTML file. Vue Router intercepts link clicks, updates the URL, and swaps the component rendered on screen — no server trip, no flash.
    - Draw on the board: MPA (browser ↔ server on every click) vs SPA (browser only talks to server for data, not for pages).

### Traditional navigation vs client-side routing

| | Multi-Page App (Traditional) | Single-Page App (Vue Router) |
|---|---|---|
| On link click | Full HTTP request to server | URL updates, component swaps |
| Page reload | ✅ Yes — everything resets | ❌ No — state is preserved |
| Server serves | A new HTML document each time | One `index.html`, always |
| Speed | Network-dependent | Instant after initial load |

### How Vue Router works

```
User clicks <RouterLink to="/movies">

Vue Router intercepts the click
      │
      ├── Updates the browser URL bar  →  /movies
      ├── Does NOT request a new page from the server
      └── Looks up the route table:
            /          →  HomeView.vue
            /movies    →  MoviesView.vue   ← matches
            /movies/:id → MovieDetailView.vue

Vue swaps the component rendered inside <RouterView />
Page updates instantly — no reload
```

### Key terms

| Term | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Route** | A mapping between a URL path and a component |
| **`<RouterView>`** | A placeholder in your layout — Vue renders the matched component here |
| **`<RouterLink>`** | Like `<a>` but intercepts the click — no page reload |
| **Route param** | A variable segment in the URL, e.g. `:id` in `/movies/:id` |
| **Navigation guard** | A function that runs before a route change — can allow, redirect, or block |

➡️ *Concepts clear. Let's install Vue Router and wire it up.*

## Phase 2 — Install & Configure Vue Router

??? note "🗣️ Talking Points"
    - Students are continuing from the Lec 2 Watchlist project. If they don't have it, the starter code is in the `movies` array below — paste it into a fresh Vite + Vue + Tailwind project.
    - Walk through the router config file slowly. The `routes` array is the entire routing table — URL on the left, component on the right. That's it.
    - The `createWebHistory` vs `createHashHistory` distinction is worth one sentence: hash mode puts a `#` in the URL (`/#/movies`) and works without any server config; history mode gives clean URLs (`/movies`) but needs the server to always serve `index.html`. Vite's dev server does this automatically.
    - After wiring everything up, open the browser and manually type `/movies` in the URL bar. Show that it loads the right component. That moment lands the concept.

### Install Vue Router

In the `movie-watchlist` project directory:

```bash
npm install vue-router
```

### Create the router file

Create a new file `src/router/index.js`:

```js title="src/router/index.js"
import { createRouter, createWebHistory } from 'vue-router' // (1)
import HomeView from '../views/HomeView.vue'
import MoviesView from '../views/MoviesView.vue'
import MovieDetailView from '../views/MovieDetailView.vue'

const routes = [ // (2)
  {
    path: '/',           // (3)
    component: HomeView,
  },
  {
    path: '/movies',
    component: MoviesView,
  },
  {
    path: '/movies/:id', // (4)
    component: MovieDetailView,
  },
]

const router = createRouter({
  history: createWebHistory(), // (5)
  routes,
})

export default router
```

1. `createRouter` builds the router instance. `createWebHistory` gives clean URLs like `/movies` instead of `/#/movies`.
2. The `routes` array is the entire routing table. Every page in your app is one entry here.
3. `path: '/'` is the root — what loads when someone visits your site's home page.
4. `:id` is a **route param** — a variable segment. `/movies/1`, `/movies/42`, `/movies/dune` all match this route.
5. `createWebHistory()` uses the browser's History API. Vite's dev server handles this automatically. On a production server you'd need to configure it to always serve `index.html`.

### Register the router in `main.js`

```js title="src/main.js"
import { createApp } from 'vue'
import './style.css'
import App from './App.vue'
import router from './router' // (1)

createApp(App)
  .use(router) // (2)
  .mount('#app')
```

1. Import the router we just created.
2. `.use(router)` installs it — this makes `<RouterView>`, `<RouterLink>`, and the `useRouter` / `useRoute` composables available everywhere in the app.

### Update `App.vue` — add `<RouterView>`

`App.vue` is now just a shell. It holds the navbar and the `<RouterView>` placeholder. Delete all the movie logic from it — that moves into `MoviesView.vue`.

```vue title="src/App.vue"
<template>
  <div class="min-h-screen bg-gray-100">

    <!-- Navbar -->
    <nav class="bg-white shadow-sm px-8 py-4 flex gap-6 items-center"> <!-- (1) -->
      <span class="text-lg font-bold text-indigo-600">🎬 Watchlist</span>
      <RouterLink to="/"        class="text-sm text-gray-600 hover:text-indigo-600">Home</RouterLink>
      <RouterLink to="/movies"  class="text-sm text-gray-600 hover:text-indigo-600">Movies</RouterLink>
    </nav>

    <!-- Active page renders here -->
    <RouterView /> <!-- (2) -->

  </div>
</template>

<script setup>
// App.vue has no logic now — each view manages its own data
</script>
```

1. `<RouterLink to="/">` renders as a regular `<a>` tag in the HTML, but Vue Router intercepts the click so no page reload happens.
2. `<RouterView />` is the slot where the matched component renders. When the URL is `/`, `HomeView` renders here. When it's `/movies`, `MoviesView` renders here.

### Create the `views/` folder

```
src/
├── components/
│   ├── MovieCard.vue
│   └── GenreBadge.vue
├── views/             ← create this folder
│   ├── HomeView.vue
│   ├── MoviesView.vue
│   └── MovieDetailView.vue
├── router/
│   └── index.js
├── App.vue
└── main.js
```

!!! note "Components vs Views — the convention"
    - `src/components/` — reusable pieces used in multiple places (`MovieCard`, `GenreBadge`)
    - `src/views/` — page-level components that map directly to a route (`MoviesView`, `HomeView`)

    Technically there's no difference — both are Vue components. The folder separation is just a widely-used convention that makes the project easier to navigate.

---

➡️ *Router is wired up. Let's build the first two pages.*

---

## Phase 3 — `HomeView` and `MoviesView`

??? note "🗣️ Talking Points"
    - `HomeView` is intentionally simple — a welcome page. Its purpose is to show that navigating to `/` renders a different component than `/movies`. That navigation moment is the demo.
    - Move the movie list logic from `App.vue` into `MoviesView.vue`. It's the same code students wrote in Lec 2 — point that out. Routing didn't change the component logic at all, it just gave it a URL.
    - After both views are done, click between Home and Movies in the navbar and show the URL changing in the browser bar. Then open DevTools Network tab and show that **no new requests are made** when navigating. That's the SPA difference.

### `HomeView.vue`

```vue title="src/views/HomeView.vue"
<template>
  <div class="max-w-2xl mx-auto px-8 py-16 text-center">
    <h1 class="text-4xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4">🎬 My Watchlist</h1>
    <p class="text-gray-500 mb-8">Keep track of movies you want to watch — and ones you already have.</p>
    <RouterLink
      to="/movies"
      class="px-6 py-3 bg-indigo-600 text-white rounded-xl font-medium hover:bg-indigo-700">
      Browse Movies
    </RouterLink>
  </div>
</template>
```

### `MoviesView.vue`

This is the movie list from Lec 2, moved into its own view. The `movies` data, the form, and the toggle logic all come with it — nothing changes functionally.

```vue title="src/views/MoviesView.vue"
<template>
  <div class="max-w-4xl mx-auto px-8 py-8">
    <div class="flex justify-between items-center mb-6">
      <h1 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800">Movies</h1>
      <button @click="showForm = !showForm"
              class="px-4 py-2 bg-indigo-600 text-white rounded-lg text-sm font-medium">
        {{ showForm ? '✕ Cancel' : '+ Add Movie' }}
      </button>
    </div>

    <!-- Add movie form -->
    <div v-if="showForm" class="bg-white rounded-xl p-5 shadow-sm mb-6">
      <h2 class="font-semibold text-gray-700 mb-4">Add a Movie</h2>
      <div class="grid grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 gap-3">
        <input v-model="newMovie.title"          placeholder="Title"    class="border rounded-lg px-3 py-2 text-sm" />
        <input v-model="newMovie.director"       placeholder="Director" class="border rounded-lg px-3 py-2 text-sm" />
        <input v-model.number="newMovie.year"    placeholder="Year"     type="number" class="border rounded-lg px-3 py-2 text-sm" />
        <input v-model="newMovie.genre"          placeholder="Genre"    class="border rounded-lg px-3 py-2 text-sm" />
        <input v-model.number="newMovie.rating"  placeholder="Rating"   type="number" step="0.1" class="border rounded-lg px-3 py-2 text-sm" />
      </div>
      <button @click="addMovie" class="mt-4 px-4 py-2 bg-indigo-600 text-white rounded-lg text-sm font-medium">
        Add to Watchlist
      </button>
    </div>

    <!-- Movie grid -->
    <div class="grid grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-4">
      <MovieCard
        v-for="movie in movies"
        :key="movie.id"
        :id="movie.id"
        :title="movie.title"
        :director="movie.director"
        :year="movie.year"
        :genre="movie.genre"
        :rating="movie.rating"
        :watched="movie.watched"
        @toggle="toggleWatched(movie.id)"
      />
    </div>
  </div>
</template>

<script setup>
import { ref, reactive } from 'vue'
import MovieCard from '../components/MovieCard.vue'

const movies = ref([
  { id: 1, title: 'Dune',                    director: 'Denis Villeneuve', year: 2021, genre: 'Sci-Fi',   rating: 8.0, watched: true  },
  { id: 2, title: 'Mad Max: Fury Road',       director: 'George Miller',   year: 2015, genre: 'Action',   rating: 8.1, watched: false },
  { id: 3, title: 'The Shawshank Redemption', director: 'Frank Darabont',  year: 1994, genre: 'Drama',    rating: 9.3, watched: false },
  { id: 4, title: 'Parasite',                 director: 'Bong Joon-ho',    year: 2019, genre: 'Thriller', rating: 8.5, watched: false },
])

const showForm = ref(false)
const newMovie = reactive({ title: '', director: '', year: new Date().getFullYear(), genre: '', rating: 7.0 })

function toggleWatched(id) {
  const movie = movies.value.find(m => m.id === id)
  if (movie) movie.watched = !movie.watched
}

function addMovie() {
  if (!newMovie.title || !newMovie.genre) return
  movies.value.push({
    id: Date.now(),
    title: newMovie.title, director: newMovie.director,
    year: newMovie.year,   genre: newMovie.genre, rating: newMovie.rating,
    watched: false,
  })
  newMovie.title = ''; newMovie.director = ''
  newMovie.year = new Date().getFullYear(); newMovie.genre = ''; newMovie.rating = 7.0
  showForm.value = false
}
</script>
```

!!! example "🎯 Try it live"
    - Click **Home** in the navbar — `HomeView` renders, URL is `/`
    - Click **Movies** — `MoviesView` renders, URL is `/movies`
    - Open DevTools → Network tab → click between pages. **No new requests.** The browser is not going to the server. Vue Router is just swapping components.

---

➡️ *Two pages working. Now let's make each movie card link to its own detail page.*

---

## Phase 4 — Route Params: `MovieDetailView`

??? note "🗣️ Talking Points"
    - Route params are the most important concept in this lecture. Take your time.
    - The URL `/movies/1` — ask: *"How does Vue know which movie to show?"* The `:id` param. It's just a variable in the URL.
    - `useRoute()` is the composable that reads the current URL's params. Show students `route.params.id` in the console before wiring it to the movie lookup.
    - The `movie` being `undefined` case is important — what if someone types `/movies/999` in the address bar? That's what Phase 6 (navigation guards) handles.
    - After the detail page works, point out that `MoviesView` and `MovieDetailView` don't know about each other at all. The URL is the connection between them.

### What we want

When a user clicks on a movie card, they navigate to `/movies/1` (or `/movies/2`, etc.). The detail page reads the `1` from the URL, finds that movie in the data, and shows a full detail view.

### Step 1 — make the movie `id` appear in the URL

We already defined the route in Phase 2:

```js
{ path: '/movies/:id', component: MovieDetailView }
```

Now we need the card to link to it. Update `MovieCard.vue` — add a `<RouterLink>` wrapping the card title:

```vue title="src/components/MovieCard.vue — updated"
<template>
  <div class="bg-white rounded-xl p-5 shadow-sm">
    <div class="flex justify-between items-start mb-3">
      <GenreBadge :genre="genre" />
      <span v-if="watched" class="text-xs font-medium px-2 py-0.5 rounded-full bg-green-100 text-green-700">✓ Watched</span>
      <span v-else          class="text-xs font-medium px-2 py-0.5 rounded-full bg-gray-100 text-gray-500">Unwatched</span>
    </div>

    <RouterLink :to="`/movies/${id}`" class="hover:text-indigo-600"> <!-- (1) -->
      <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-800">{{ title }}</h2>
    </RouterLink>
    <p class="text-sm text-gray-500 mt-1">{{ year }} · {{ director }}</p>

    <div class="flex justify-between items-center mt-4">
      <span class="text-yellow-500 font-semibold">★ {{ rating }}</span>
      <button @click="emit('toggle')" class="text-sm text-indigo-600 hover:underline">
        {{ watched ? 'Mark unwatched' : 'Mark watched' }}
      </button>
    </div>
  </div>
</template>
```

1. `:to="\`/movies/${id}\`"` builds the URL dynamically using the `id` prop. Clicking the title navigates to `/movies/1`, `/movies/2`, etc. without a page reload.

### Step 2 — create `MovieDetailView.vue`

```vue title="src/views/MovieDetailView.vue"
<template>
  <div class="max-w-2xl mx-auto px-8 py-8">

    <!-- Back link -->
    <RouterLink to="/movies" class="text-sm text-indigo-600 hover:underline mb-6 inline-block">
      ← Back to Movies
    </RouterLink>

    <!-- Loading state — movie not found yet -->
    <div v-if="!movie" class="text-gray-400 mt-8 text-center">Movie not found.</div>

    <!-- Movie detail -->
    <div v-else class="bg-white rounded-xl p-8 shadow-sm">
      <div class="flex justify-between items-start mb-4">
        <GenreBadge :genre="movie.genre" />
        <span v-if="movie.watched" class="text-xs font-medium px-2 py-0.5 rounded-full bg-green-100 text-green-700">✓ Watched</span>
        <span v-else               class="text-xs font-medium px-2 py-0.5 rounded-full bg-gray-100 text-gray-500">Unwatched</span>
      </div>

      <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-1">{{ movie.title }}</h1>
      <p class="text-gray-500 mb-1">{{ movie.year }} · {{ movie.director }}</p>
      <p class="text-yellow-500 font-semibold text-lg mb-6">★ {{ movie.rating }}</p>

      <button @click="toggleWatched"
              class="px-5 py-2 bg-indigo-600 text-white rounded-lg text-sm font-medium hover:bg-indigo-700">
        {{ movie.watched ? 'Mark as Unwatched' : 'Mark as Watched' }}
      </button>
    </div>

  </div>
</template>

<script setup>
import { computed } from 'vue'
import { useRoute } from 'vue-router' // (1)
import GenreBadge from '../components/GenreBadge.vue'

const route = useRoute() // (2)

// Temporary local data — in Lec 5 this moves to a Pinia store
const movies = [ // (3)
  { id: 1, title: 'Dune',                    director: 'Denis Villeneuve', year: 2021, genre: 'Sci-Fi',   rating: 8.0, watched: true  },
  { id: 2, title: 'Mad Max: Fury Road',       director: 'George Miller',   year: 2015, genre: 'Action',   rating: 8.1, watched: false },
  { id: 3, title: 'The Shawshank Redemption', director: 'Frank Darabont',  year: 1994, genre: 'Drama',    rating: 9.3, watched: false },
  { id: 4, title: 'Parasite',                 director: 'Bong Joon-ho',    year: 2019, genre: 'Thriller', rating: 8.5, watched: false },
]

const movie = computed(() => { // (4)
  const id = Number(route.params.id) // (5)
  return movies.find(m => m.id === id) ?? null
})

function toggleWatched() {
  if (movie.value) movie.value.watched = !movie.value.watched // (6)
}
</script>
```

1. `useRoute()` is a composable provided by Vue Router. It gives access to everything about the current URL — params, query strings, path, name.
2. `route` is now a reactive object. `route.params.id` gives us the `:id` part of the URL as a string.
3. The data is duplicated here for now — `MoviesView` and `MovieDetailView` each have their own copy. This is the problem Pinia solves in Lec 5. Point this out explicitly.
4. `computed` is the right choice — if the route changes (e.g. user navigates from `/movies/1` to `/movies/2`), the computed re-runs automatically.
5. `route.params.id` is always a **string** — even if the URL is `/movies/1`, the param is `"1"`. `Number()` converts it so the `===` comparison with `movie.id` (a number) works correctly.
6. This mutates the local copy — it won't affect `MoviesView`. Again, Pinia fixes this.

!!! example "🎯 Try it live"
    - Navigate to `/movies`
    - Click a movie title — URL changes to `/movies/1`
    - The detail page renders with that movie's data
    - Click ← Back to Movies — returns to the list
    - Manually type `/movies/99` in the URL bar — "Movie not found." appears

!!! warning "The data duplication problem"
    Right now `MoviesView` and `MovieDetailView` each hold their own copy of the `movies` array. Toggling watched on the detail page doesn't affect the list page — they're two separate arrays.

    **This is intentional.** It's the exact problem Pinia (Lec 5) exists to solve. For now, note it and move on.

➡️ *Clicking links works. Sometimes you need to navigate from code — not from a click.*

---

## Phase 5 — Programmatic Navigation

??? note "🗣️ Talking Points"
    - Ask: *"What if you want to navigate after a form submission? Or after a successful login? There's no link to click — the navigation happens in JavaScript."*
    - `useRouter()` vs `useRoute()` — easy to mix up. Route (no r) = read the current URL. Router (with r) = navigate to a new URL.
    - The `router.push()` vs `router.replace()` distinction is one sentence: `push` adds to history (back button works), `replace` replaces the current entry (back button skips it — useful for login redirects).

### `useRouter` — navigate from code

`useRoute` reads the current URL. `useRouter` lets you *navigate* to a new one.

```js
import { useRouter } from 'vue-router' // (1)

const router = useRouter()

// Navigate to a path
router.push('/movies')

// Navigate to a named route with a param
router.push({ path: `/movies/${id}` })

// Navigate back
router.back()

// Replace current history entry (no back button)
router.replace('/login')
```

1. Two composables — easy to mix up. **`useRoute`** (no r at the end) = read the URL. **`useRouter`** (with r) = change the URL.

### Example — navigate after adding a movie

Update the `addMovie` function in `MoviesView.vue` to navigate to the new movie's detail page after it's added:

```js title="MoviesView.vue — updated addMovie"
import { useRouter } from 'vue-router' // (1)

const router = useRouter()

function addMovie() {
  if (!newMovie.title || !newMovie.genre) return

  const id = Date.now()
  movies.value.push({
    id,
    title: newMovie.title, director: newMovie.director,
    year: newMovie.year,   genre: newMovie.genre, rating: newMovie.rating,
    watched: false,
  })

  // Reset form
  newMovie.title = ''; newMovie.director = ''
  newMovie.year = new Date().getFullYear(); newMovie.genre = ''; newMovie.rating = 7.0
  showForm.value = false

  router.push(`/movies/${id}`) // (2)
}
```

1. Import `useRouter` alongside the existing `useRoute` import (or just add it here if not already imported).
2. After adding the movie, navigate straight to its detail page. The user sees their new entry immediately.

!!! example "🎯 Try it live"
    Open the add movie form, fill it in, and click Add. Instead of just appearing in the grid, the app navigates directly to the new movie's detail page. The URL becomes `/movies/<timestamp>`.

---

➡️ *The last piece — what happens when a URL doesn't match anything valid?*

---

## Phase 6 — Navigation Guards

??? note "🗣️ Talking Points"
    - Students often think navigation guards are just for authentication. True, but today's use case — redirecting when a movie doesn't exist — is simpler and more relatable.
    - `beforeEnter` runs before a route is entered. It receives `to` (destination route) and `from` (current route). Returning `false` cancels the navigation. Returning a path string redirects.
    - After the guard works, type `/movies/999` in the URL bar again. Instead of showing "Movie not found", the user gets bounced back to `/movies`. That's the UX improvement.
    - The auth guard example at the end is a preview — students will need it for assignments.

### What is a navigation guard?

A function that runs **before** a route loads. It can:

- ✅ Allow the navigation (return nothing or `true`)
- ↩️ Redirect to a different route (return a path string)
- ❌ Cancel the navigation (return `false`)

### `beforeEnter` — guard a single route

Add a `beforeEnter` guard to the movie detail route in `src/router/index.js`:

```js title="src/router/index.js — updated"
import { createRouter, createWebHistory } from 'vue-router'
import HomeView from '../views/HomeView.vue'
import MoviesView from '../views/MoviesView.vue'
import MovieDetailView from '../views/MovieDetailView.vue'

const movies = [ // (1)
  { id: 1 }, { id: 2 }, { id: 3 }, { id: 4 },
]

const routes = [
  { path: '/',       component: HomeView },
  { path: '/movies', component: MoviesView },
  {
    path: '/movies/:id',
    component: MovieDetailView,
    beforeEnter: (to) => { // (2)
      const id = Number(to.params.id) // (3)
      const exists = movies.some(m => m.id === id) // (4)
      if (!exists) return '/movies' // (5)
    },
  },
]

const router = createRouter({
  history: createWebHistory(),
  routes,
})

export default router
```

1. The guard needs to know which IDs are valid. In a real app this would come from an API or a Pinia store — for now we keep a minimal list here.
2. `beforeEnter` receives `to` (the route being navigated to) and optionally `from`. It runs before the component mounts.
3. Extract and convert the `:id` param — same `Number()` trick as in the view.
4. `Array.some()` returns `true` if any element matches the condition.
5. Returning a string path redirects the user. They never see `MovieDetailView` — they land on `/movies` instead.

!!! example "🎯 Try it live"
    - Type `/movies/999` in the URL bar — you land on `/movies` instead of "Movie not found"
    - Type `/movies/2` — the detail page loads normally

### `router.beforeEach` — global guard (preview)

For auth checks you often want to protect many routes at once. Add a global guard in `router/index.js` after `createRouter`:

```js
router.beforeEach((to, from) => { // (1)
  const isLoggedIn = false // replace with real auth check later

  if (to.path !== '/' && !isLoggedIn) { // (2)
    return '/' // redirect to home if not logged in
  }
})
```

1. `beforeEach` runs before **every** navigation in the app. It's the right place for global auth logic.
2. This says: "if the user is going anywhere other than home, and they're not logged in, send them home." In a real app, you'd check a Pinia store or a cookie here.

!!! note "We'll use this for real in Lec 5"
    Once we have a Pinia store with an `isLoggedIn` state, the global guard becomes genuinely useful. For now, just understand the pattern.

## Phase 7 — Pitfalls & Wrap-up

??? note "🗣️ Talking Points"
    - The `route.params.id` is a string pitfall trips almost every student the first time. It's worth a slow demo — show `typeof route.params.id` in the console.
    - The `<a>` vs `<RouterLink>` one is quick but important — using `<a>` causes a full page reload and resets all Vue state.

### ❌ Forgetting that route params are strings

```js
const id = route.params.id         // ❌ "1" — a string
const movie = movies.find(m => m.id === id)  // ❌ 1 !== "1" — finds nothing

const id = Number(route.params.id) // ✅ 1 — a number
const movie = movies.find(m => m.id === id)  // ✅ works
```

### ❌ Using `<a>` instead of `<RouterLink>`

```vue
<a href="/movies">Movies</a>          <!-- ❌ full page reload — Vue state resets -->
<RouterLink to="/movies">Movies</RouterLink> <!-- ✅ client-side navigation -->
```

### ❌ Using `useRoute` when you need `useRouter` (and vice versa)

```js
const route  = useRoute()   // ✅ read: route.params, route.query, route.path
const router = useRouter()  // ✅ navigate: router.push(), router.back()

router.params.id   // ❌ router doesn't have params
route.push('/...')  // ❌ route can't navigate
```

### ❌ Defining routes after `createRouter` is called

```js
const router = createRouter({ routes })
routes.push({ path: '/new', component: NewView }) // ❌ too late — router already built

// ✅ All routes must be in the array before createRouter() is called
```

## Summary

**What we added to the Watchlist:**

| Phase | What changed |
|---|---|
| 2 — Install & configure | `vue-router` installed, `router/index.js` created, `<RouterView>` in `App.vue` |
| 3 — Home + Movies pages | Two views, `<RouterLink>` navbar, URL-driven rendering |
| 4 — Detail page | `/movies/:id` param, `useRoute()`, `computed` lookup |
| 5 — Programmatic nav | `useRouter()`, `router.push()` after form submit |
| 6 — Navigation guard | `beforeEnter` redirects invalid IDs, `beforeEach` preview |

**The mental model:**

```
URL bar:  /movies/2
              │
              ▼
        router/index.js
        matches: /movies/:id
        param:   id = "2"
              │
              ▼
        MovieDetailView.vue
        useRoute().params.id → "2" → Number() → 2
        movies.find(m => m.id === 2) → { title: "Mad Max...", ... }
              │
              ▼
        Page renders with that movie's data
```

**The data problem we deliberately left unsolved:**

Toggling watched on the detail page doesn't affect the list page — they have separate data copies. This is what Pinia (Lec 5) solves: one shared store, any view can read from it or update it.

### Coming up next

| Lecture | Topic |
|---|---|
| **Lec 4** | Lifecycle hooks · `watch` · Fetching real data from an API |
| Lec 5 | Pinia — one shared `movies` store, fixes the data duplication |
| Lec 6 | Composables — extracting reusable logic |

!!! tip "Practice before Lec 4"
    1. **404 page** — add a `NotFoundView.vue` and a catch-all route `{ path: '/:pathMatch(.*)*', component: NotFoundView }`. It should show a friendly message and a link back home.
    2. **Active link styling** — Vue Router automatically adds a class `router-link-active` to the active `<RouterLink>`. Style it in your navbar so the current page is visually highlighted.
    3. **Query string filter** — on the `/movies` page, make the All / Watched / Unwatched filter buttons update the URL to `/movies?filter=watched`. Read it back with `route.query.filter` to apply the filter on load.
