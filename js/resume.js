        objective: "Through the past 14 years, I have gained an enormous amount of experience in the web design and development during serving in multiple roles among various institutions around the world. Most of the positions I have held involved web design as a major component. Tens of websites, web applications and portals I played as the leading designer in the development team. On the other hand, when I started my graduate studies at Western, I assisted in teaching web design courses in the majority of my time. I was assigned as the lead teaching assistant over years in these course. I helped hundreds of first and second year students to practically and theoretically understandi the web design and development using HTML/CSS both in in-person and over zoom course delivery. I strongly believe that I can bring a lot to this course since I have the skills and qualifications needed to successfully deliver such course.  ---------- I am a business analyst with experience of successful project delivery, particularly in the internal e-services industry as my latest two positions.I am adaptable, have a good understanding of commercial and business issues, a strong technical background, Problem-Solving, Critical Thinking, Visual Modeling and excellent communication skills. This allows me to fulfil a variety of different roles within project teams, and provide an effective interface between business and technical functions. ******** A highly focused software developer with 8 yearsâ€™ experience in a variety of development and engineering positions. Organised, methodical and a keen eye for detail results in solid coding and trustworthy software programmes. I am adaptable, have a good understanding of commercial and business issues, a strong technical background in .Net, Problem-Solving, Critical Thinking, Visual Modelling and excellent communication skills. This allows me to fulfil a variety of different roles within project teams, and provide an effective interface between business and technical functions.",
